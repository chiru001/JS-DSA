for (let i=1; i>0; i++){

/*

DRYRUN:
First time:
    i = 1, 1>0 = True | so print hellow world  | count:1

Second time:
    i++ = 1 + 1 = 2
    i = 2, 2>0 = True | so print hellow world  | count:2
    
3rd time:
    i++ = 2 + 1 = 3
    i = 3, 3>0 = True | so print hellow world  | count:3
4th time:
    i++ = 3 + 1 = 4
    i = 4, 4>0 = True | so print hellow world  | count:4

This will keep on going it will never stop so this is called INFINITE LOOP
